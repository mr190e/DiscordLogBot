# DiscordLogBot
Logfile Forward Discord Bot


This NodeJS bot checks for new entries to a logfile and than forwards them to a discord channel. Make sure to don't use it on a logfile which gets hundreds of entries per second, as you will run into rate limitation.

Feel free to commit and fork.

To run the bot install just use

```
git clone https://github.com/mr190e/FileSenderBot

npm install

nano config.json

node bot.js
```
This bot is based on Discord.js v13
